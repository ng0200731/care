## Version 2.1.48 - Fixed Mother Edit Button Availability
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Fixed Mother Edit Button**: Removed restriction that prevented editing mother objects when regions exist
  - **Problem**: Edit button disappeared after creating regions, forcing users to delete all regions to edit mother
  - **Root Cause**: Edit button condition included `context !== 'projects'` which was blocking access
  - **Solution**: Simplified condition to only check `isWebCreationMode`
  - **Result**: Users can now edit mother objects at any time, regardless of regions

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Simplified Edit Logic**: Removed unnecessary context restrictions for mother editing
- **Better User Experience**: No longer need to delete regions to modify mother properties
- **Consistent Behavior**: Edit functionality now available throughout the workflow

## Version 2.1.47 - Fixed Header & Mid Fold Line Padding Visualization
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üéØ UI/UX Improvements
- **Fixed Header for Edit Mother Dialog**: Header now stays fixed at top when scrolling
  - **Problem**: Header scrolled with content making it hard to see dialog title
  - **Solution**: Added `position: sticky, top: 0, zIndex: 10` to header
  - **Benefit**: Always visible dialog title and drag handle
- **Scrollable Content Area**: Dialog content now has max height with scroll
  - **Implementation**: `maxHeight: '400px', overflowY: 'auto'`
  - **Benefit**: Better space management for long forms

### üé® Visual Enhancement
- **Mid Fold Line Padding Visualization**: Added visual padding areas around mid fold lines
  - **Horizontal Lines**: Shows padding areas above and below the fold line
  - **Vertical Lines**: Shows padding areas left and right of the fold line
  - **Styling**: Semi-transparent red rectangles (`#d32f2f`, 30% opacity)
  - **Purpose**: Clearly shows restricted areas where regions cannot be placed

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Canvas Rendering**: Improved mid fold line visualization system
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Padding areas use same color as fold lines for clarity
- **Responsive Design**: Padding visualization scales with zoom level
- **User Experience**: Better visual feedback for layout constraints

## Version 2.1.46 - Fixed Leftover Space Size Calculation
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Fixed Leftover Space Size**: Resolved incorrect size calculation for "Occupy leftover space" content
  - **Problem**: Algorithm was finding 13√ó116mm instead of full remaining space (18√ó126mm)
  - **Root Cause**: `findLargestAvailableRectangle()` finds largest single rectangle, not all remaining space
  - **Solution**: Replaced with simple subtraction approach for leftover space calculation
  - **Result**: Leftover content now uses full remaining area as expected

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Simplified Algorithm**: Direct calculation of remaining space instead of complex rectangle finding
- **Better Logic**: Prioritizes space to the right, then below existing content
- **Accurate Sizing**: Uses actual remaining dimensions (region.width - usedWidth)
- **Debug Enhancement**: Updated debug output to show new calculation method

## Version 2.1.45 - Fixed Debug Panel Infinite Re-render
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Fixed Infinite Re-render Loop**: Resolved "Too many re-renders" error in debug panel
  - **Problem**: `setDebugInfo` calls during render cycle caused infinite re-render loop
  - **Solution**: Use `setTimeout` to defer state updates outside render cycle
  - **Approach**: Debug info stored using async state updates with proper TypeScript typing
  - **Result**: Debug panel works without causing render loops

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Render-Safe Debug Storage**: Debug info updates deferred using `setTimeout`
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Fixed variable typing issues for `overlayX` and `overlayY`
- **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders, debug info updates asynchronously
- **User Experience**: Clear button restored, debug panel shows real-time calculations

---

## Version 2.1.44 - Added Debug Panel for Leftover Space
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üêõ Debug Enhancement
- **Added On-Screen Debug Panel**: Real-time debugging information displayed on web page
  - **Problem**: Console logs are too sensitive and hard to copy due to mouse movements
  - **Solution**: Debug panel shows leftover space calculations directly on the page
  - **Features**: Shows region dimensions, existing content, found space, and positioning info
  - **UI**: Fixed position panel with clear button, scrollable, and professional styling

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Debug State Management**: Added `debugInfo` state to store debug messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Debug info updates as leftover space calculations occur
- **User-Friendly Display**: Formatted debug information with clear labels and structure
- **Easy Access**: No need to open browser console, information visible on page

## Version 2.1.43 - Fixed "Occupy Leftover Space" Positioning
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üêõ Critical Positioning Fix
- **Fixed Content Positioning for "Occupy Leftover Space"**: Content now properly positions in calculated available space
  - **Problem**: Content was using vertical stacking position instead of calculated horizontal position
  - **Result**: Content appeared as thin line at bottom instead of occupying right half
  - **Solution**: Store and use calculated position (x, y) from space detection algorithm
  - **Positioning**: Content now correctly positions at calculated coordinates within region

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Position Storage**: Store calculated position in content object for rendering
- **Conditional Positioning**: Use calculated position for leftover content, normal stacking for others
- **Stack Management**: Leftover content doesn't affect vertical stacking of other content
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced positioning debug information

---

## Version 2.1.42 - Fixed "Occupy Leftover Space" Logic
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
**Commit:** TBD

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Fixed "Occupy Leftover Space" Content Logic**: Completely rewrote the leftover space calculation
  - **Problem**: Content with "Occupy leftover space" was only looking for vertical space (remaining height)
  - **Result**: Content appeared as thin horizontal line instead of occupying available horizontal space
  - **Solution**: Now finds largest available rectangular area within the region
  - **Works with**: All scenarios (with/without mid-fold lines, any region configuration)

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Space Detection**: Uses existing `findLargestAvailableRectangle()` function
- **Proper Content Positioning**: Calculates actual content rectangles for space analysis
- **Region Boundary Respect**: Content stays within region boundaries
- **Content Overlap Prevention**: Avoids overlapping with existing content
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### üéØ Scenarios Fixed
- **No Mid-Fold**: Content properly occupies right half of region (W=50%, H=100%)
- **Horizontal Mid-Fold**: Content occupies available space in respective regions
- **Vertical Mid-Fold**: Content occupies available space in respective regions
- **Any Region Size**: Logic works consistently across all region configurations
