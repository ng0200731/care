CONFIRMED! Complete Version Management Protocol
I understand and will follow this exact protocol for EVERY code change:

ðŸ“‹ Mandatory Workflow for ALL Code Changes:
1. Version Increment Strategy:
âœ… EVERY code change = Version increment (even smallest fixes)
Patch increment for small fixes: 1.7.1 â†’ 1.7.2
Minor increment for new features: 1.7.1 â†’ 1.8.0
Major increment for breaking changes: 1.7.1 â†’ 2.0.0
2. Commit Message Format:
âœ… DETAILED descriptions required
Format: v#.#.# - [Detailed description of what was changed and why]
Examples:
3. Testing Requirement:
âœ… ALWAYS test in browser before committing
Verify functionality works as expected
Check version display updates correctly in UI
Confirm no compilation errors
ðŸŽ¯ Complete Workflow Steps:
For EVERY code change, I will:

Update package.json version (increment appropriately)
Make code changes
Test in browser (open URL and verify functionality)
Verify version display shows new version in UI
Execute git workflow:
ðŸ“± Current Status:
Current Version: v1.7.1
Next Version: Will be v1.7.2 for next change
Protocol: CONFIRMED and ready to implement
I will follow this exact protocol for every single code change going forward! ðŸŽ¯

Ready to proceed with disciplined version management! âœ…
